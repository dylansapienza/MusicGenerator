Dylan's Music Generator
Revised 5/8/2019

The program generates musical chord progressions based on several conditions.
	
	-Tonal Harmony (Only picks chords that reside in a key)
			-Major (Major Keys)
			-Minor (Minor Keys)

			-V7 Chord (Replaces the 5th chord in the key with an extended 7th chord)

		-Functional Harmony (Follows functional harmonic practices, replaces the final chord with the I chord and the second to last chord with the V chord)
			-Secondary Dominant (Places the V7/V before the V chord in the generated progression)
	
	-Atonal Harmony (Selects random chords to generate the progression)
	
	-Amount of Chords: Users can input into a text box how many chords they want generated.
		Due to popular music conventions I decided to cap this at 16 bars.
	
	-Time Delay: Users can select how many seconds and milliseconds exist between sucessive chords.
	
	-Generate Button: Generates a chord progression based on the modifiers the user has selected. Outputs into the console the chords in the key with their number correspondants.
	
	-Play: Plays the progression that has been generated. Plays the stored progression until one has been generated. Outputs into the console the chords being played.

	-Outputs information into text box rather than the complier console

	-Allow Users to specify a key
